# TeamViewerDecrypt - Powershell

Just a quick dirty Powershell implementation of [whynotsecurity](https://github.com/whynotsecurity/)Â´s Teamviewer decrypt script.

All credit goes to him, blog post can be found here: https://whynotsecurity.com/blog/teamviewer/

Not all passwords in every version can be decrypted using this script. I could not decrypt Teamviewer v14/v15 PermanentPasswords so far.

As always only use for educational or pentesting purposes. :)
